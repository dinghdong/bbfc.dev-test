## 在 VuePress 基础上改进

There're couple of things that are improved from VuePress.

### It Uses Vue 3

Leverages Vue 3's improved template static analysis to stringify static content as much as possible. Static content is sent as string literals instead of JavaScript render function code – the JS payload is therefore *much* cheaper to parse, and hydration also becomes faster.

Note the optimization is applied while still allowing the user to freely mix Vue components inside markdown content – the compiler does the static/dynamic separation for you automatically and you never need to think about it.
